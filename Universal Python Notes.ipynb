    "# What is Python?\n",
    "#### Python refers to a <b>open-source, high-level, object-oriented , interpreted, multipurpose, cross-platform, dynamatically typed</b> programming language.\n",
    "## Let's learn the above terms:\n",
    "#### <b>Open-Source:</b> Python is open-source, which means that its source code is freely available, and the Python community actively contributes to its development. This has led to a wealth of libraries and frameworks that extend Python's capabilities.\n",
    "#### <b>High-Level:</b> Python is a high-level programming language, which means that it abstracts many low-level details and provides a more human-readable syntax. This makes it easier to write and understand code.\n",
    "#### <b>Interpreted Language:</b> Python is an interpreted language, meaning that code is executed line by line by the Python interpreter. This makes it easy to write and test code without the need for a separate compilation step.\n",
    "#### <b>Multi-Purpose:</b> Python is a versatile language that can be used for a wide range of applications. It has a rich standard library that includes modules for tasks such as file handling, networking, and more.\n",
    "#### <b>Cross-Platform:</b> Python is available for multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and various Unix-like operating systems. This makes it a suitable choice for developing applications that can run on different platforms.\n",
    "#### <b>Dynamic Typing:</b> Python is dynamically typed, which means that you don't need to declare variable types explicitly. Variable types are determined at runtime.\n",
    "#### <b>Object Oriented:</b> Python is designed to use objects as the fundamental building blocks of programs. In object-oriented programming, data and the functions (methods) that operate on that data are organized into \"objects.\" "

    "# Python variables:\n",
    "### In Python, variables are used to store and manipulate data. Unlike some other programming languages, Python is dynamically typed, which means you don't need to explicitly declare the data type of a variable when you create it. Here are some key points about Python variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable Naming Rules:\n",
    "1. Variable names can consist of letters, numbers, and underscores.\n",
    "2. Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore.\n",
    "3. Python is case-sensitive, so my_variable and My_Variable are considered different variables.\n",
    "4. Variable names cannot be a Python keyword or reserved word, such as if, else, while, for, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable Assignment:\n",
    " Variables are created when you assign a value to them using the = operator. For example: x = 10 creates a variable named x and assigns it the value 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamic Typing:\n",
    "- Python variables are dynamically typed, which means you don't need to specify the data type explicitly.\n",
    "- The data type of a variable is determined by the value it holds.\n",
    "- For example, x = 10 creates an integer variable, while x = \"Hello\" creates a string variable. "
